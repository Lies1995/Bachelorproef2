As described in section \ref{subsubsec:CoreDia} TEM images of the particles are created to determine their shape and core diameter. According to the synthesis protocol used (see section \ref{subsubsec:Turk} and appendix) spherical particles are expected.  Several images are created of the three different colloids (expected size $15$nm, $30$nm and $45$nm) in advance of the PEG functionalization, thus of naked gold nanoparticles. In figure \ref{fig:TEM} one image of each colloid is shown in combination with a histogram indicating the size distribution. The data in the histogram is a combination of data from several images.\\
The TEM images show approximately spherical nanoparticles. They cluster together due to Van der Waals interactions but do not aggregate due to the electrostatic repulsion of the citrate ions surrounding the naked particles.
The average size calculated from the data is presented in table \ref{tab:TEM}.
For the particles with expected size of $45$nm, the observed average size is slightly larger and for the smallest particles slightly smaller. This diversion though was expected due to the limitations on the work precision.
The particles requiring attention are  the ones with expected size $30$nm. They are more then $10$nm smaller compared to the size the protocol predicts. The reason for this deviation lies most certainly in the experimental handling of the protocol since many other experimenters have used the protocol and did obtain the expected results  \cite{spaas}.
Since the particles are smaller, presumably a higher concentration of citrate is added to the gold solution. This can happen due to wrongful pipetting work or evaporation of the gold solution while bringing it to boiling temperature. The last one seems unlikely since during the heating a condenser was used with a continuous flow of cold water.\\
The size distributions of the two largest particles, figures \ref{fig:TEM}(b) and (d), indicate a wide spreading around the average.
If more data had been collected a gaussian size distribution would have been expected since the growth of nanoparticles depends on various random factors. For the particles of expected size $30$nm the size distribution approximates a normal gaussian distribution whereas the distribution for the largest particles appears to be negatively skewed. For the smallest particles though, clearly a subpopulation with a diameter around $4$nm is present. The reason for this subpopulation is not sure, not enough particles were analyzed to draw immediate conclusions. A possibility is that there was an unequal distribution of the citrate in the gold solution due to unsystematic stirring.

\subsection{Relative Size (UV-Vis)}
\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption{Absorption spectra for naked GNP of expected size $15$nm, $30$nm and $45$nm}
  \label{fig:UV-VIS all naked}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:UV-VIS all naked} presents the absorption spectra of the naked gold nanoparticles, thus before the functionalization with PEG. The figure clearly indicates the mechanism of the UV-Vis measurements. Larger particles have a lower surface plasmon frequency, hence the larger wavelength at which maximum absorption occurs.\\
The most important application of the UV-Vis measurements is to determine the necessary proportion of PEG/GNP solution as described in section \ref{subsubsec:RelSize}.
The reasoning to determine the ideal PEG/GNP proportion from the measurements will be explained here for the $20$k PEG. The same reasoning applies for the other PEG's. In figure \ref{fig:UV-VIS 15nm 20k} four absorption spectra (with different PEG/GNP ratio) for the smallest particles ($15$nm) functionalized with $20$k PEG are presented. Both the curves before and after the addition of NaCl (to stimulate aggregation) are shown. The results for the other particles can be found in the appendix. Each time only four (out of ten) absorption spectra are shown for the sake of clarity of the figure. \\
When no salt is added, the four absorption maxima from the different spectra should coincide and that is also what has been measured, see figure \ref{fig:UV-VIS 15nm 20k}. Even with insufficient PEG-coating the particles will not immediately aggregate together since they are then still slightly coated with negative citrate ions causing additional electrostatic repulsion.

\begin{wraptable}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
  \caption{Necessary PEG/GNP proportions (volume/volume) for each PEG to create a stable colloid. The proportions are valid for a $1$g/l PEG solution and a GNP solution obtained from the protocol described in the appendix. }
  \label{tab:PEG/GNP}
  \vspace{-10pt}
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ c | c }
    PEG & PEG/GNP \\
    \toprule
    $1$k & $4/100$\\
    $5$k& $4/10$\\
    $10$k & $6/10$\\
    $20$k & $8/10$
  \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{wraptable}

When adding NaCl the electrostatic effects will disappear and only the particles coated with enough PEG to provide the necessary steric repulsion will hold their size. Clearly, a $1/10$ ratio is not enough since with NaCl a secondary peak rises at a higher wavelength indicating the presence of larger particles. The peak of the $4/10$ absorption spectrum broadens upon addition of salt indicating there's still little aggregation. Almost no difference is observed between the $8/10$ and $10/10$ ratio so the ideal proportion is $8/10$ since we look for the minimum necessary PEG/GNP proportion.\\
The determined PEG/GNP proportions for the four different PEG's are listed in table \ref{tab:PEG/GNP}. Remarkable is the fairly low proportion necessary when working with the smallest PEG (length $1$k). When variating the PEG/GNP proportion between $1/10$ and $10/10$ it was observed that the lower the proportion, the better the reaction of the colloid to the salt. Lowering even further, this trend remained, see figure \ref{fig:UV-VIS 15nm 1k}. This is strange and contradicts the theory. It is correct that less PEG (in mass) is needed when using the smaller PEG since in $1$g more PEG molecules are present (This is observed for the other PEG's). However, this does not explain why when using $1$k PEG there suddenly seems to be a maximum PEG proportion at which the colloid becomes unstable again. Since this is only observed with the smallest PEG it has to have something to do with the length of the PEG chain. In a shorter PEG chain the negative charge of the thiol group becomes more significant. When there is an over-saturation of PEG in the colloid, the negative charges of the thiol groups at the surface of the particles will start to repel each other. This process causes a weaker bound between the PEG and the nanoparticles facilitating aggregation upon NaCl addition. This explanation has not been tested nor theoretically verified due to time limits. It is worth investigating this strange interaction of GNP and $1$k PEG when a stable GNP colloid with smallest particles possible is desired.
After the necessary PEG/GNP proportion was determined based on the absorption spectra with the smallest particles, control measurements were done with the absorption spectra from the larger particles. An example with $20$k PEG is shown in figure \ref{fig:UV-VIS all 20k}. This figure indeed indicates that all three colloids don not aggregate after being mixed with NaCl.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic Radius (DLS)}

Figure \ref{fig:DLS no PEG} contains three histograms, one for each particle, showing the detected size by the nanoQ software for all ten measurements. These measurements are made before the functionalization thus represent the hydrodynamic radius of naked particles. For the two largest particles the measurements indicate subpopulation. These smaller particles are also observed in the TEM analysis although it are especially the smallest particles that have a subpopulation (see figure \ref{fig:TEM}(f)). This subpopulation is not discovered with this detection method perhaps because they are to small.  For each particle the main population has a slightly larger radius than the expected size. This is normal since the particles are still in an aqueous solution and will be functionalized with citrate ions and water molecules.

  \label{fig:DLS no PEG}
\end{wrapfigure}
Figure \ref{fig:DLS} shows the results for the hydrodynamic radius for all particles and all kinds of PEG. On this figure for each combination (kind of PEG and size of GNP) only one result is shown. Mostly though the DLS analysis resulted in finding two populations of particles, a polydisperse solution. In table \ref{tab:DLS} the exact numerical results and errors are listed, including the ones for the second (smaller) population.\\
In a figure such as figure \ref{fig:DLS} you would expect to see an augmenting trend moving from No PEG to 20k PEG in hydrodynamic radius. Also, the larger particles should always be larger than the smaller particles.\\
The first property is violated when using the $1$k PEG. A larger hydrodynamic radius when functionalizing with $1$k PEG than  with a larger PEG ($5$k, $10$k and $20$k) is strange and seems to be a wrong measurement.
\\
The measurements were repeated several times and extra attention has been paid.
Sometimes it was observed that the power of the incident laser fluctuated abnormally, reaching frequently the maximum count rate. Other times the opposite happened.
Even with the highest laser power not enough counts were recorded (the ideal instantaneous count rate is between $2500$-$3000$ counts). These problems affect the correctness of the calculations and could announce for the strange values for $R_h$ and huge error bars on the measurements. \\
The second property is violated when using the $20$k PEG. Here the $15$nm particles suddenly have a largerhydrodynamic radius than the $30$nm particles. These measurement were also repeated several times an the observed problem was a again a lack of counts. In trying to solve the problem the sample was centrifuged but this did not improve anything. Since the results were consistently wrong, new samples from $15$nm particles with other PEG/GNP proportion (from $5/10$-$9/10$) were analyzed in the hope to find an answer. These samples were also centrifuged since the previous measurements had large errors.  The results are shown in table \ref{tab:15nm 20k var}. Centrifuging the samples to obtain a higher count rate reduces slightly the errors and the average values are more in the line of what is expected. Considering the good results for the not centrifuged and centrifuged samples and relatively small errors, the $5/10$ PEG/GNP proportion seems to be a better choice for the smallest particles when functionalizing with 20k PEG. A control UV-Vis measurement was performed to check whether the colloid with this PEG/GNP proportion is stable and turned out positively. \\
An answer for this strange behavior could be the steric hindrance of the long PEG chains on each other. When packed tightly on the surface of the GNP the PEG chains will be elongated while with lower proportions the chains can be more compact. This is called the mushroom or brush effect (see figure \ref{fig:brush}).
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gfx/brush}
  \caption{Schematic representation of two possible configurations of polymers on a surface; Brush and mushroom configuration}
  \label{fig:brush}
\end{figure}
But still, this cannot be the whole story. When synthesizing the particles, all solutions started with an equal amount of gold ions. Hence, in the colloid with the smallest particles, a lot more surface needs to be covered with PEG than for the larger particles (in total). Thus you would expect to need more PEG for smaller particles which contradicts our measurements.\\
From this all we can state that the concentration of PEG necessary to stabilize the colloid is a complex system and depends on many factors. The details of all interactions taking place in the coating mechanism is an interesting topic to investigate but beyond the scope of this project.\\
In table \ref{tab:DLS} the exact numerical results of the average size is shown and frequently a subpopulation is detected. Whether this is really a subpopulation or just a resonance effect in the measurements is unsure. The sizes of the subpopulations do not agree with the sizes found with the TEM image analysis. More DLS measurements should be executed in order to determine what these subpopulations are.\\
To summarize, the functionalization with $1$k PEG behaves strange thus further results with these GNP have to be interpreted carefully and secondly that the colloid with the smallest GNP ($15$nm) functionalized with the largest PEG $20$k should have a PEG/GNP proportion of $5/10$ in stead of $8/10$ as was determined with the UV-Vis measurements (see table \ref{tab:PEG/GNP}).

\subsection{Stability of the colloid ($\zeta$-potential)}
The $\zeta$-potential measurements are done to determine the particle surface charge. Ten measurement are done for each combination of the three different GNP, without PEG and with $1$k, $5$k, $10$k and $20$k PEG.  The normalized intensity distribution of the $\zeta$-potential for the $45$nm particles without PEG are shown in figure \ref{fig:Zeta_45}. It can be seen that there are some fluctuation in these results. The average is calculated and plotted as the black curve in figure \ref{fig:Zeta_45}. The results and their average where then fitted with a Lorentzian fit, as is shown in figure \ref{fig:Zeta_45_fit}. \\
The averages resulting form the fits are shown in table \ref{tab:zeta}, together with a statistical error. It is clearly visible that when no PEG is used, the $\zeta$-potential is significantly more negative, then when PEG is used. This is as expected, because without PEG negative citrate ions establish a negative $\zeta$-potential. For the smallest GNP, the $\zeta$-potential is approximately $-30$mV, so that this solution can be considered stable. For the larger nanoparticles however the $\zeta$-potential is slightly larger than $-30$mV (smaller in absolute values). For these solutions it is uncertain whether the electrostatic repulsion is large enough to form a stable colloid. Fortunately a PEG coating is added for the targeting which provides extra stability using steric repulsion. As can be seen in table \ref{tab:zeta}, coating the GNP with PEG has a neutralizing effect on the $\zeta$-potential, as is expected due to the methoxyl end-group. For some samples this neutralizing effect is much more pronounced and the $\zeta$-potential is approximately zero, for example $30$nm with $5$k PEG. For others the effect is smaller, as can be seen for the $15$nm particles. One would expect that larger PEG molecules lead to a less negative $\zeta$-potential, because larger PEG molecules have a larger neutralizing effect. This however is only observed here for the smallest GNP. It is not clear why the results of the larger nanoparticles are inconsistent with the expectations.
Another remarkable result of the $\zeta$-potential measurements is that of the $30$nm GNP with $1$k PEG where a $\zeta$-potential of $4.48$mV is measured. THe negatively charged citrate can be neutralized using PEG, but a positive $\zeta$-potential is unexpected and cannot be explained. Additional $\zeta$-potential measurements will probably provide some answers.

\subsection{DNA damage analysis}
The DNA samples with different GNP and different PEG, together with a reference sample, are irradiated. Due to practical errors, the samples of the $15$nm particles with $10$k and $20$k PEG have the wrong GNP vs. PEG proportion, namely $7.2$/$10$ and $6$/$10$ instead of $6$/$10$ and $5$/$10$. Furthermore the sample of the $15$nm particles with $1$k PEG is not analyzed due to an error while preparing the sample. After the irradiation, gel electrophoresis is performed in order to analyze the DNA damage. Figure \ref{fig:gel1} shows an image of the gel electrophoresis results for the samples that were irradiated with a $5$Gy dose. This figure shows only a part of the image that was taken from the gel. The lower band represents circular DNA and the upper band is supercoiled DNA, since the samples have moved from the bottom to the top of the figure. The intermediate band, which is not clearly visible, represents linear DNA. In this project DNA damage is defined as the sum of the intensities of the circular and linear DNA bands divided by the total intensity. In figure \ref{fig:gel1} column $12$ is the reference sample, where no GNP were added. By comparing the intensities of the bands of the reference sample with the bands of the other samples the radiosensitization effect is visible. The intensities of the circular en linear band of the reference sample are much lower than the others. In column $4$ one may also notice less DNA damage. That is probably a result of an error during the centrifuging of the sample, because after the centrifuging it was noticed that that sample had a much lighter color than the other samples indication a lower GNP concentration. The dark background in column $8$ is a result of the movement of the GNP itself trough the gel due to the applied voltage. Normally the nanoparticles should have a neutral surface potential, but as was already seen in the $\zeta$-potential results, that is not always the case. Unfortunately the results here cannot be compared with the ones of the $\zeta$-potential. Different GNP solutions where used, which can have slightly different properties.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{gfx/gel}
  \caption{Gel electrophoresis results for $5$Gy. Column $1$ to $4$ are the $45$nm GNP coated with $20$k, $10$k, $5$k and $1$k PEG, column $5$ to $8$ are the $30$nm GNP coated with $20$k, $10$k, $5$k and $1$k PEG, column $9$ to $11$ are the $30$nm GNP coated with $20$k, $10$k and $5$k PEG and the last one is the reference sample, where no GNP are added.}
  \label{fig:gel1}
\end{figure}


Using the definition of DNA damage as stated before, more quantitative calculations can be made. Intensity profiles of all samples where obtained by using imageJ and the area under the peaks where calculated. By dividing the area of the circular and linear peak by the total area, DNA damage percentages are obtained. For example $50\%$ damage means that $50\%$ of the DNA strands in that sample are damaged. To get the extra damage caused by the radiosensitization effect, the damage of the reference sample has to be subtracted. Figure \ref{fig:animals} shows the measured DNA damage for different nanoparticles at $0$Gy, $5$Gy, $10$Gy and $15$Gy. Here the damage of the reference sample was not subtracted, but the reference is also plotted so that the radiosensitization effect is still visualized. Since DNA damage increases for increasing doses, rising curves are expected. This is not the case here, although figure \ref{fig:30} for the $30$nm particles shows a small rising trend. It can be seen though that all the curves more or less follow the trend of the reference sample, which itself has a strange form. This strange form indicates that possibly something went wrong with the DNA itself. Due to some practical problems much time has passed between the preparation of the samples, the irradiation and the gel electrophoresis and because DNA is a fragile macromolecule it is possible that it was already damaged due to wrong storage between these different stages. This could also explain why the reference sample shows already damage at $0$Gy. Little damage at $0$Gy is always expected, because the initial DNA is not purely supercoiled. This apparent time factor has been verified by an extra measurement with DNA stored in optimal conditions until right before the gel electrophoresis. This new reference sample showed much less damage, see figure \ref{fig:new}. %TODO: figure
Another thing that can be seen is that (except for the particles with $1$k PEG and the $15$nm GNP with $10$k and $20$k PEG) the DNA damage with GNP is larger than the damage when no nanoparticles are added to the DNA. This is the radiosesitization effect. Additionally it can be noticed that in generally smaller PEG gives more DNA damage (except for $1$k PEG). This is especially visible for the $30$nm particles. The $1$k PEG gives very strange results, namely that it seems to lead to less DNA damage than without GNP. As stated before the nanoparticles coated with $1$k PEG sometimes have a negative surface potential and move along with the DNA in the electric field. Column $8$ of figure \ref{fig:gel1} indicates that this diminishes the visibility of the bands and hinders the intensity analysis with ImageJ. Strange results for particles coated with $1$k PEG where also obtained before in the characterization methods. Even though the results cannot really be compared because new GNP where synthesized for the DNA damage analysis. Finally it can be seen that larger particles appear to have a slightly larger radiosensitization effect that smaller ones. Unfortunately this contradicts literature \cite{lies}. However one has to keep in mind that the centrifuging process is more difficult for smaller GNP due to their smaller masses. Therefore it is expected that for the smaller GNP, more particles will be lost in the centrifuging process, resulting in a smaller total gold concentration and diminishing the radiosensitization effect.
