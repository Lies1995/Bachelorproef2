\subsection{Conclusion}
Synthesizing gold nanoparticles following the Turkevich method is a reliable way to obtain particles of a specific size. Though, one always has to keep in mind that smaller particles are also created and that the system is very sensitive to slight deviations of concentration. To be certain about the size distributions of the particles in a colloid TEM image analysis is the best and most reliable way. In the $15$nm particle colloid a subpopulation has been found, probably due to unequal distribution of the citrate ions in solution. \\
Throughout all measurements the particles functionalized with $1$k PEG provide strange results. First, there seems to be a maximum PEG/GNP proportion at which point the colloid becomes unstable again and the particles start to aggregate. One would expect that once the whole surface of the particles is coated with a PEG-layer, which provides the necessary steric repulsion to prevent aggregation, adding more PEG does not influence this equilibrium. Secondly, the hydrodynamic radius of the $1$k PEG functionalized particles appears to be larger then the $R_h$ of particles with the same core diameter but functionalized with larger PEG. The $\zeta$-potential results are also questionable and vary from extremely negative to even positive.
%#TODO something about the DNA damage due to the 1 k PEG--> why it is bad
If the $1$k PEG needs to be used for medical application further research is needed to account for and eliminate this strange behavior.
\\The characterizations for the other particles are mostly what was expected. In measuring the hydrodynamic radius using the DLS technique though some technical problems were observed with the laser. This can account for unexpected results and large errors. The measurements have to be interpreted carefully before they are generalized. \\When ignoring the result for particles functionalized with $1$k PEG, the expected trend that functionalization with larger PEG corresponds to larger hydrodynamic radii is observed. The $\zeta$-potentials for the functionalized samples is mostly measured to be neutral as it should be due to the methoxy end-group.
