Structure thesis:

Introduction:
  *radiation problems
  *clear problem statement
Theoretical Background:
  *biological effect radiation,
  *language,
  *why gold GNP?,
  *Functionalisation
  *(Clear statement of both goals; targeting + stabilization)
Material And Methods:
  Synthesis
    - Synthesis GNP (chemical Protocol)
      * Mechanism
      * 3 different sizes
    - Functionalisation GNP
      * Mechanism
      * 4 different types PEG
  Characterization
    - Radius GNP: TEM
      * Mechanism (short!!)
      * analyzed with imageJ (short!!)
    - Hydrodynamic radius: DLS
      * Terminology: What is the hydrodynamic radius
      * Mechanism
    - Relative size GNP:  UV-VIS
      * Mechanism --> measure relative size
      * use for determination proportion PEG
    - surface potential: Zeta-potential
      * What surface potential
      * Mechanism
Results And Discussion
  Characterization
    - Radius GNP: TEM
      *Image + Histogram --> for each particle
      *Table with results + error (statistical)
    - Relative size GNP:  UV-VIS
      *determination PEG
      --> graph before and after PEG for (15nm 5k) in text (see presentation)
          others in appendix
      --> Table with chosen PEG proportions for each PEG
             | PEG/GNP
        20k  |
        10k  |
        5k   |
        1k   |
      * 1 final graph 20k with three nanoparticles with correct PEG functionalisation (others in appendix)
    - Hydrodynamic radius: DLS
      * 1 Histogram example ( 15nm 5k) 1 size, 1 PEG, all measurements
      ! tweede populatie ook rapporteren !
      *For every PEG (1k, 5k, 10k, 20k) table
      Average from all valid measurements
      +error (see lab book)
        20k | No PEG | PEG |
      0.8   |        |     |
      1.24  |        |     |
      2.5   |        |     |
      *discussion problem smallest particles
    - surface potential: Zeta-potential
      * 1 Graph example (to be determined) 1 size, 1 PEG, all graphs
      * table with all results
