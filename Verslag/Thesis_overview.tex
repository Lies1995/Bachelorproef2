Introduction:
  radiation problems
  clear problem statement
Theoretical Background:
  biological effect radiation,
  language,
  why gold GNP?,
  Functionalisation
  (Clear statement of both goals; targeting + stabilization)
Material And Methods:
  Synthesis
    - Synthesis GNP (chemical Protocol)
      * Mechanism
      * 3 different sizes
    - Functionalisation GNP
      * Mechanism
      * 4 different types PEG
  Characterization
